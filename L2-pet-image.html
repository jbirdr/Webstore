    <p>Your dog is a friend for life.  Why not provide it with the best care possible?</p>
    <p>Make sure your pet has plenty of <strong>fresh water</strong> during hot weather.  When
    taking your dog on long walks, bring a collapsible water dish and bottled water.  You
    can find specialty water dishes at many pet supply stores for $10 or less.</p>
