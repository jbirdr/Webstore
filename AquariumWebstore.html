      <h3>Making the Most of this Webstore</h3>
      <p>Starting and maintaining a successful aquarium is predicated by knowing what type of aquarium you want.  Will  it be a fish-only aquarium or will it have plants or other living organism in it?  Will if be freshwater of saltwater? Will you build a living reef aquarium, with fish, live corals, crustateans and other invertabarates?  Once this choice has been made, then picking out the aquarium, filtration, lighting and other accesories will be much easier.</p>

      <p>The other thing to realize is that this aquarium, regardless of what you choose, will be a living, thriving, closed ecosystem.  That means that everything in the aquarium and filtration will be reliant on each other.  One can not exist without the other.  There will be a small amount of chemistry and biology that you will have to understand, but nothing too complicated that can't be mastered in a short period of time.</p>
