      <h1>The vacation I never took.</h1>

        <p>Recently, I never went on vacation.  I never went to a warm carbean location,
        where I never met George Clooney and his new wife.  We never took a private plane out to his private island, neither
        did we dine on cocktail shrimp or drink fine champagne.</p>
        <p>We did not act out scenes from his movie Michael Clayton.<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465538/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_20">ImDB</a>
        And after partying all night, we didn't excersice with Richard Simmons in the morning.</p>
